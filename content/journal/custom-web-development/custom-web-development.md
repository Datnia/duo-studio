Custom web development has revolutionized the digital landscape, empowering businesses to have unique online identities. Imagine a website made specifically for you which will have your brand’s personalized touch, speak to your target audience and differentiate you in your market. That’s the benefits of custom - it’s like getting an outfit tailored just for your body. 

There’s a lot that goes into a good website and it requires both the expertise of seasoned developers and designers. We will discuss the strategic approach of custom design and its importance in establishing a robust web presence for your business.

We'll also explore what effect this has on search engines. SEO is the big buzzword and if your website doesn't have this optimized, you can lose out on potential leads. We'll distinguish between front-end and back-end development techniques and how they play into a typical webpage. A good web development team will seamlessly incorporate both practices into a website.

And we'll take a look at the different content management systems (CMS) and what pros and cons ready-made templates have when compared to a custom coded website. The discussion will extend to the scalability of a customized website vs pre-made templates and which better benefits your potential customers.

From the design elements to SEO to the different programming languages, there's a lot to unpack when discussing the details of custom web solutions. And whether you're a big enterprise or a small business, a well-done customized website will benefit you. Let's jump right in.


<h2 id="planning">Planning and More Planning: The Strategic Approach to Web Development</h2>

Websites, like many things in business, requires an intentional and thoughtful strategy. Rather than just spinning up a simple template from one of the popular website builders, a planned custom design is important when building your website. You're unique and shouldn't look like everyone else.

<h3 id="tailored">Tailored to perfection: the benefits of going custom</h3>

1. **Site speed** - Site builders, like WordPress, gets a bad rep for having slow loading times while custom developers only use code that is necessary to the site which significantly reduces load time. We have about an 8-second attention span, make sure you get your business' point across quickly.
2. **Brand awareness** - When leveraging thoughtful and custom web design, web development teams are able build sites as intended with the unique personality of a business. They're also able to implement a business' desired specifications, from colors, fonts, motion and more.
3. **User friendly** - Ready-made templates serve the majority; custom development serve you. And that also goes for your users. Pre-made templates won't have specific functionality that a tailored website has - that can make a difference when connecting with your audience or standing out from your competitors.

<h3 id="strong-presence">Strong web presence matters</h3>

In the modern competitive landscape, having a strong web presence is essential. Think of your website as your (digital) home - you want your prospects to have the best impression when entering. A professionally designed website can do just that. From educating them on your offerings or sharing ideas with your blog content, your website is supposed to do everything, effortlessly. The worst response is for people to think, "Oh, I've seen this a million times."

With your website, be a trendsetter, not a follower. Next we'll look at the importance of SEO and how effective it can be when paired with custom web solutions.

<h2 id="seo">Custom Web Development and SEO</h2>

We've already discussed how custom web development solutions benefit your business and its digital presence. But what about the effect it has on SEO? We'll dive into it in this section but get ready for some technical jargon. We won't go too deep in explaining SEO, feel free to read about it [here](https://moz.com/learn/seo/what-is-seo){target="_blank"}.

<h3 id="plugin">A plugin for this and a plugin for that: a custom developer's nightmare</h3>

Does your current site have endless plugins that need to be updated? And are all of your current plugins actively serving you or just slowing down your site? 

The flexibility that comes with a custom website build will delight any experienced developer. Unlike pre-made templates, custom sites are built with easy access to the code-base and this will play a huge role in search engine optimization. For reference, here are important SEO terms and how a customized approach will benefit your ranking:

- **On-Page SEO**: Refers to the structure and content of your webpage. Good on-page SEO consists of having the appropriate headings, text, image alt tags and internal linking system. Think of each page of your site as little strings of data that are connected via links. A customized website will give developers full control over the design and structure of the page.
- **Technical optimization**: We briefly touched upon the speed benefits that custom solutions have for a website but how does that translate to SEO? Search engines tend to award the faster loading site when comparing you to your competitors. Other benefits include, clean code-base, proper URL structure and mobile responsiveness. These are all vital things that a simple template are unable to do.
- **Schema markup and structured data**: This is the information that helps search engines understand the context and meaning of your webpage. With custom websites, adding these to your webpages will be simple for any web development company. Typical structured data will look like this:
    
    ```jsx
    <script type="application/ld+json">
    {
        "@context": "https://schema.org/",
        "@type": "Recipe",
        "name": "Party Coffee Cake",
        "author": {
            "@type": "Person",
            "name": "Mary Stone"
        },
        "datePublished": "2018-03-10",
        "description": "This coffee cake is awesome and perfect for parties.",
        "prepTime": "PT20M"
    }
    </script>
    ```

The key takeaway is that pre-built themes limit specific functionality and hinder your SEO efforts. While there are plugins like Yoast for WordPress, which allows you to embed structured and meta data to your webpage, this won't affect the page speed or layout - there's another plugin for that. However, should you add a bunch of random plugins to your site? The answer is no - your developers and potential customers will thank you.

<h3 id="impact-on-traffic">Impact on traffic and conversion rates</h3>

To increase online visibility, paring SEO best practices with a customized website will positively impact traffic and conversion rates. When your site ranks high on SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages), it naturally attracts more visitors who are likely interested in what you offer.

This increase in targeted traffic often translates into higher conversions since these users are already searching for your product or service. Just make sure your website is optimized for conversions because you don't want them to leave empty-handed.

Custom web development also allows businesses to optimize their website's structure, content, loading speed, and user experience to attract more specific traffic and boost conversion rates. Make sure you rank before your competitors.

<h2 id="frontend-backend">Front-End and Back-End Coding</h2>

When you think of a website what do you see? Usually it's the text, images or buttons on a webpage. This is referred to as the front-end - think of it as front facing/client facing part. But what about when you interact with it? For example, when you "like" something or submit a form, where does the information get processed? Yep, in the back-end! These two sides need to work seamlessly for a site to be successful. With website builders, there's no ensuring that these sides will exchange data the way you want. Here are some commonly used programming languages:

- JavaScript
- Python
- Ruby
- PHP
- Swift
- Go
- TypeScript
- HTML/CSS (not technically programming languages, but fundamental for web development)
- Shell scripting languages (e.g., Bash, PowerShell)
- SQL (Structured Query Language) for database management.

<h3 id="frontend">The front-end: design and the user</h3>

Front-end development refers to the process of creating user-facing components of a website, like sections, sidebars, buttons and form fields. It involves custom web design, implementation, and optimization of the visual and interactive elements. From intentional layouts to user-friendly menus, front-end developers use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to make websites look amazing with user experience in mind. All in all, it’s what you usually see when you’re on a webpage. Want to learn more? Check out [W3Schools' guide on HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp){target="_blank"}.

<h3 id="backend">The back-end: behind the scenes</h3>

Back-end developers build the server-side components of a website or web app - the things we don't see. They work with languages like PHP or Python and databases like MongoDB or MySQL. This also includes the implementation of the logic, database interactions, and server operations that power the functionality and data management of a website or app. Another example is API (application programming interface) development, which allows websites to interact with external services; an example is connecting it to a CRM (Customer Relationship Manager), like HubSpot, Salesforce or Mailchimp.

<h2 id="cms">Content Management Systems (CMS)</h2>

With all this talk about developers, programming and code, how will non-technical people be able to manage their own websites? Believe it or not, a customized approach with the desired specifications will make editing your site easier. Now with modern frameworks and tried-and-true platforms like WordPress, it's possible to craft the perfect content management system for anyone.

<h3 id="wordpress">WordPress and custom themes</h3>

With about [43% of websites being built on WordPress](https://colorlib.com/wp/wordpress-statistics){target="_blank"}, we can assume that many people are familiar with its user-friendly dashboard. Web developers that are building custom themes are able to leverage the familiar dashboard while only using what's necessary. This is a good solution for business owners but be mindful of the amount of plugins - think "less is more."

<h3 id="headless-cms">Headless CMS</h3>

Headless CMS is a content management approach that separates the content creation and management capabilities from the presentation layer of a website or application. So in your traditional CMS, the content management is integrated with the front-end of the website like WordPress' Gutenberg blocks. However the content management system is decoupled ("headless") from the front-end, allowing more freedom in the content delivery.

Now with all of these modern frameworks around, web developers are incorporating headless CMS more than ever. Some examples are [Sanity.io](http://sanity.io/){target="_blank"}, [Strapi](https://strapi.io/){target="_blank"}, [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/){target="_blank"} and [Hygraph](https://hygraph.com/){target="_blank"}. Good things happen when you personalize your website and its content management system: you unlock an efficient and easy-to-use workflow.

<h2 id="scalability-security">Scalability & Security</h2>

Now that we've covered the benefits of custom web development solutions when it comes to SEO and content management, let's also discuss maintaining and scaling the website. By having full control of what code is deployed to your website, you create your own architecture and limit what can be accessed.

<h3 id="grow">Grow with your business</h3>

As your business grows, so should your website. For custom web development teams, they build websites while keeping in mind how components will be added in the future. Here are things to consider when sizing-up:

1. **Architecture** - Custom developers pay attention to creating a scalable architecture that can accommodate growing traffic and increasing user demands. They'll also optimize the infrastructure to handle heavier loads efficiently.
2. **Flexible code-base** - As you need new features, blog content or sections, a custom built website is written in organized code making easier to add functionalities without disrupting the entire website.
3. **Integration** - Developers can leverage cloud services, content delivery networks (CDNs), and distributed computing architectures to handle additional requests that a business may need. Think about adding CRMs or connecting your website with an API.

Overall, custom web development allows businesses to think about scalability from the beginning.

<h3 id="staying-safe">Staying safe: web security</h3>

Your website is out there in the world and anyone can access it - make sure you have security parameters in place. When investing in a custom website, you're also taking steps to mitigate any risks with cybercrime. According to a [Cybersecurity Ventures report](https://cybersecurityventures.com/hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016){target="_blank"}, cybercrime is on the rise, costing trillions worldwide. Don't be a victim and save yourself from potential reputational damage and long-term costs. Your web development team will:

1. **Implement secure coding practices** - Custom developers will follow secure coding practices from the ground up. They implement security guidelines, such as input validation and proper authentication. They'll also set up protection against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting - ensuring that your data remains safe.
2. **Take appropriate security measures** - A term you may hear is "Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)," an encryption based internet security protocol. Web developers implement secure communication protocols (HTTPS) and access control parameters to protect sensitive data.
3. **Follow compliance standards** - Custom web development teams follow requirements assigned by the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), PCI DDS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).

Ready-for-you templates will not have these security measures in place. When working with a development company, be sure they're addressing these points.
