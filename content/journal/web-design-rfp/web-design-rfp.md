You're about to take the first step in looking for vendors to create (or evolve) your business' website. Where do you start? Where do you look? What information should you have ready before searching? In this article, we will go over what you need when working with any digital design agency and how to write the perfect website design RFP. 

This guide will familiarize you with the process of engaging with a design agency, regardless of whether your company typically writes RFPs or not. A well-structured RFP can significantly impact the web design and development process and can make a difference between a successful project and an unsuccessful one.

First, we will dive into the various features that make up a web design RFP. This includes setting clear project goals, technical requirements, like templating systems and site architecture, as well as aligning your online presence with current marketing objectives. Be sure to emphasize these essential elements in the RFP.

Then, we‚Äôll take an objective look at your current site and your ideal end-goal. When writing your website design RFP, it's crucial to determine whether you require a complete overhaul or slight design tweaks. This initial information will provide a clear understanding of your future growth projections and enable you to establish precise budget ranges.

Finally, we'll cover the evaluation criteria for agency selection and how to spot potential red flags. Keep in mind that the RFP process requires time and effort from both you and your vendors, so make sure you‚Äôre communicating your requirements effectively. 

Get ready to write!

<h2 id="rfp">The Website Design RFP (Request for Proposal)</h2>

An RFP is what it sounds like; it‚Äôs a document that announces an upcoming project, provides relevant details and requests potential vendors to bid on it. So in this case, if your business is writing a web design RFP, your document would have:

1. Cover page
2. Company background
3. Project overview
4. Project scope
5. Website examples
6. Existing website details
7. Budget
8. Timeline
9. Vendor specifications
10. Selection process
11. Submission directions

Your RFP should begin with an introduction of your company and an explanation of the project requirements. Providing helpful references, like your competitor's site or your existing website, will assist vendors in visualizing the goal. Next, clearly outline the directions for RFP submission and the selection criteria. Provide details for each requirement in your RFP, ensuring your vendor reads and comprehends it, enabling them to submit a perfect proposal for the job. If you do this well, your vendors will think "wow, this company knows what they want.‚Äù 

Be sure to download our website design RFP template below to guide you through the process!

<h2 id="cover-page">1. Cover Page</h2>

Don't underestimate the significance of the front page in your website design RFP! It's the first impression your potential vendors will have of your company, so establish the groundwork immediately. Include the RFP‚Äôs title, submission date and some brief information on where and who they will submit their responses to. The cover page also acts as a filter for vendors who might have accessed this file passed the due date.

**Google Search Tip:** If you do this, Google will pull the text on your cover page and show the information in the meta description:

<h2 id="background">2. Your Company: History & Background</h2>

After the cover slide, you‚Äôll want to share information about your company, like when it was founded, where it‚Äôs located, your values and what makes you great. This is your moment to add your personal touch to the proposal and describe what's important to you! Being personable will increase the likelihood of receiving a response from a vendor.

<h2 id="overview">3. Project Overview: Setting Clear Project Goals</h2>

Clearly communicate your vision with the website, focusing on what your current site lacks and what you‚Äôre trying to achieve with your new site. Help potential design agencies understand the desired outcome as they're reading through the rest of your RFP. There's a lot that you can say when it comes to your business and its current challenges. Don't worry if you're noticing this section becoming bulky - it might be tough unraveling your business' pain points but it helps tremendously when you're writing your website design RFP. By communicating your pain points to your vendors, it'll set you up for success in the collaboration since you‚Äôre already aligned.

### Brief

Provide a quick snapshot of the project to help agencies grasp the context and scale so they understand your goals and capabilities. Keep it brief and focus on the big picture at first - you‚Äôll go into more details later.

### Challenges

Now you want to get into the specifics about the challenges you‚Äôre facing with the website. Identify problem areas that are preventing your business from performing at the best level. Whether it‚Äôs load speed, functionality, or design, it‚Äôs important to be as concise with this section as possible. It helps potential agencies understand your expectations and provide targeted proposals to fit your needs.

### Goals

Finally, you want to let your vendors know what would make this project a success. Include an all-encompassing statement that highlights what the new website should be able to do. Remember to also provide a list of general capabilities that will solve your challenges. If you find that this section is getting too overwhelming, it might be a good idea to separate items into ‚Äúmust haves‚Äù and ‚Äúnice to haves‚Äù.

Again, feel free to refer to the template for examples.

<h2 id="scope">4. Project Scope: Technical Specifications</h2>

After you've exhausted your business' problems, now it's time to solve them (or at least try to). We use the word "try" because good digital agencies will reject certain demands if they believe it won't get you your intended results. Agencies hold the expertise to separate the things you want from the things you need, including unnecessary design requests or complicated development features. Keep in mind the primary focus for web design projects is to create an engaging and user-friendly online presence with improved branding. It‚Äôs beneficial to break the scope into different categories.

### Design

Share the visual elements of your brand and preferred content with potential web design companies, including materials from your current brand guidelines or marketing resources. This helps vendors grasp your brand‚Äôs identity and ensures a consistent and recognizable look on your new website, thus streamlining the design process.

### Sitemap & Architecture

Once you've provided the visual direction, the next step is to define the existing web pages and to decide if you want to add pages. Feel free to simplify this list by highlighting the top-level pages unless there are important project requirements in the sub-pages. Naturally, you‚Äôll end up with a list that‚Äôs essentially your sitemap. No need to get fancy need to get fancy with diagrams, a list of your current or additional pages will work. 

A well-crafted website design RFP includes specific requirements for your site architecture and templating systems.

### Technology

In this section, we'll go over web development based features that you may add in your website design RFP. Try not to make it too technical, the development team will find the solutions. Instead, focus on highlighting specific requirements you need to solve your business goals.

**Content Management System (CMS)**

If you have an internal team responsible for managing the content of your site, mention this in your website design RFP. Inform your vendors about your existing CMS and expectations for the new website. As they‚Äôre reading through your RFP, they'll start envisioning what you need for a successful project.

**Third-Party Integrations**

Do you have a CRM for your digital marketing? Do you want to have a map embed on your new site? Or does your business require specific user authentication for logins? List out all the third-party integrations connected to your site and consider any additional features you want to add. Be clear about these specific requirements and triple check this so you don‚Äôt leave necessary integrations out. 

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

You've might've heard about SEO before and it‚Äôs an important feature to factor in when considering a new website. SEO is the practice of enhancing a website to increase its visibility on search engines and there are many factors involved, like on-page, off-page, local and keywords. Be clear about the functionality requirements - feel free to learn more about it [here](https://moz.com/learn/seo/what-is-seo){target="_blank"}. As you're writing your RFP, include any existing metrics and what goals you'd like to achieve for the search engine result pages (SERPs). Let your vendors know that you want to rank above your competitors or just higher than where you are now.

### Security and Maintenance

It would be a shame to go through an entire website project just to end up with a crashed or hacked site. While digital agencies typically follow security protocols, you can reinforce this by setting clear expectations on security. Specify if you'll need SSL certificates, firewalls, and/or scheduled updates. This leads to the topic of maintenance. 

Do you have an internal team that can of manage website files or backups? If you do, provide a list of requirements for the access they'll need. If you don‚Äôt, be transparent on whether you expect the selected vendor to handle site maintenance. Keep in mind that this impacts the budget.

This is the most important part of your website design RFP. Establishing a clear budget range will save time for both you and potential vendors by ensuring you two are a good match. In this section, share how you intend to allocate your budget and whether there‚Äôs wiggle room for negotiation. Reputable design agencies will maximize the value they deliver within your specific budget, so make sure to think this one through!

Okay, we‚Äôre almost to the finish line! Now it‚Äôs time to get specific about what you‚Äôre expecting to see in the proposal. Include an outline for your vendors to follow when crafting their proposal, such as their company background, cost proposal, and related projects.

Additionally, if you have any deal breakers in terms of the agency itself, make sure to include that too. Listing out your requirements will help weed out agencies that aren‚Äôt a good fit. Is it absolutely required that your agency is based in the US? Should the agency have 5 years of e-commerce experience? Include all of that information in your RFP.

<h2 id="bonus">Bonus: Finding Your Perfect Agency</h2>

Now that you have your professionally written RFP, you'll need vendors to send them to. You might have a list of companies that you're excited to work with but if you don't, find them, stalk them and reach out to them.

- **Google** - Google is a great resource to look for vendors, especially if  you prefer to work with a local agency. Give it a try! Hop on Google, do a quick search, check out their reviews and proximity to you. If they're nearby, in-person meetings can also be valuable.
- **Directory sites** - There are a bunch of directories from Clutch, Awwwards and Crunchbase where you can find agencies and their portfolio of work.
- **Social media** - Social media is another great tool to research potential vendors. This can also be used as an extension as the previous examples. For example you can find agencies on Google or Awwwards and continue learning about them from their social profiles.
- **Word of mouth** - Have a friend that recently worked a digital design agency? Or are you a part of a group or online forums? Reach out to them to learn about that company and what it was like working with them.

Your design project is important and you want to engage with the right company to handle your project. With numerous methods available for reaching out to agencies, pick a few that feels best for you!
