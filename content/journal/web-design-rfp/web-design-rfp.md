Custom web development has revolutionized the digital landscape, empowering businesses to create unique online identities. Imagine a website that is made specifically for your target audience with your brand's personalized touch and will differentiate you in your market.

A good website requires experienced developers and designers. We will discuss the strategic approach of custom design and its importance in establishing a robust web presence for your business.

We'll also explore what effect this has on search engines. SEO is the big buzzword and if your website doesn't have this optimized, you can lose out on potential leads. We'll distinguish between front-end and back-end development techniques and how they play into a typical webpage. A good web development team will account for these factors when building your website.

And we'll take a look at the different content management systems (CMS) and what pros and cons ready-made templates have when compared to a custom coded website. The discussion will extend to the scalability of these pre-made templates and if it can benefit your potential customers.

From the design elements to SEO to the different programming languages, there's a lot to unpack when discussing the details of custom web solutions. Whether you're a big enterprise or a small business, a well-done customized website will benefit you. Let's jump right in.



<h2 id="planning">Planning and more planning: The Strategic Approach to Web Development</h2>

Rather than just spinning up a simple template from one of the popular website builders, custom design is important when building your website. You're unique and shouldn't look like everyone else.

- **On-Page SEO**: Refers to the structure and content of your webpage. Good on-page SEO consists of having the appropriate headings, text, image alt tags and internal linking system. Think of each page of your site as little strings of data that are connected via links. A customized website will give developers full control over the design and structure of the page.
- **Technical optimization**: We briefly touched upon the speed benefits that custom solutions have for a website but how does that translate to SEO? Search engines tend to award the faster loading site when comparing you to your competitors. Other benefits include, clean code-base, proper URL structure and mobile responsiveness. These are all vital things that a simple template are unable to do.
- **Schema markup and structured data**: This is the information that helps search engines understand the context and meaning of your webpage. With custom websites, adding these to your webpages will simple for any web development company. Typical structured data will look like this:
    
    ```jsx
    <script type="application/ld+json">
    {
        "@context": "https://schema.org/",
        "@type": "Recipe",
        "name": "Party Coffee Cake",
        "author": {
            "@type": "Person",
            "name": "Mary Stone"
        },
        "datePublished": "2018-03-10",
        "description": "This coffee cake is awesome and perfect for parties.",
        "prepTime": "PT20M"
    }
    </script>
    ```
    

The key takeaway is that pre-built themes limit specific functionality and hinder your SEO efforts. While there are plugins like Yoast for WordPress, which allows you to embed structured and meta data to your webpage, this won't affect the page speed or layout - there's another plugin for that. However, should you add a bunch of random plugins to your site? The answer is no - your developers and potential customers will thank you.

<h3 id="impact-on-traffic">Impact on traffic and conversion rates</h2>

In addition to increasing online visibility, effective SEO practices within customized websites directly impact traffic and conversion rates. When your site ranks high on SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages), it naturally attracts more visitors who are likely interested in what you offer.

This increase in targeted traffic often translates into higher conversions since these users are already searching for your product or service. Just make sure your website is optimized for conversions because you don't want them to leave empty-handed.

Custom web development is essential for improving SEO and increasing online visibility. It allows businesses to optimize their website's structure, content, loading speed, and user experience to attract more targeted traffic and boost conversion rates. Make sure you rank before your competitors.

## Front to Back Coding

When you think of a website what do you see? Usually it's the text, images or buttons on a webpage. This is referred to as the front-end - think of it as front facing/client facing part. But what about when you interact with it? For example, when you "like" something or submit a form, where does the information get processed? Yep, in the back-end! These two sides need to work seamlessly for a site to be successful. With website builders, there's no ensuring that these sides will exchange data efficiently. Here are some commonly used programming languages:

- JavaScript
- Python
- Ruby
- PHP
- Swift
- Go
- TypeScript
- HTML/CSS (not technically programming languages, but fundamental for web development)
- Shell scripting languages (e.g., Bash, PowerShell)
- SQL (Structured Query Language) for database management.

### The front-end: design and the user

Front-end development references the process of creating the user-facing components of a website. It involves custom web design, implementation, and optimization of the visual and interactive elements. From intentional layouts to user-friendly menus, front-end developers use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to make websites look amazing with user experience in mind. Want to learn more?

### The back-end: behind the scenes

Back-end developers build the server-side components of a website or web app - the things we don't see. They work with languages like PHP or Python and databases like MongoDB or MySQL. This also includes the implementation of the logic, database interactions, and server operations that power the functionality and data management of a website or application. Another example is API (application programming interface) development, which allows websites to interact with external services; think of this as CRM integration.

## Content Management Systems (CMS)

With all this talk about developers and code, how will non-technical people be able to manage their own websites? Believe it or not, a customized approach with the desired specifications will make editing your site easier. Now with modern frameworks and tried-and-true platforms like WordPress, it's possible to craft the perfect content management system for anyone.

### WordPress and custom themes

With about [43% of websites being built on WordPress](https://colorlib.com/wp/wordpress-statistics){target="_blank"}, we can assume that many people are familiar with its user-friendly dashboard. Web developers that are building custom themes are able to leverage the familiar dashboard while only using what's necessary. This is a good solution for business owners but be mindful of the amount of plugins - think "less is more."

### Headless CMS

Headless CMS is a content management approach that separates the content creation and management capabilities from the presentation layer of a website or application. So in your traditional CMS, the content management is integrated with the front-end of the website - think WordPress' Gutenberg blocks. However the content managemnet system is decoupled ("headless") from the front-end, allowing more freedom in the content delivery.

Now with all of these modern frameworks around, web developers are incorporating headless CMS more than ever. Some examples are [Sanity.io](http://sanity.io/){target="_blank"}, [Strapi](https://strapi.io/){target="_blank"}, [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/){target="_blank"} and [Hygraph](https://hygraph.com/){target="_blank"}. Good things happen when you personalize your website and its content management system: you unlock an efficient and easy-to-use workflow.

## Scalability & Security

Now that we've covered the benefits of custom web development solutions when it comes to SEO and content management, let's also discuss maintaining and scaling the website. By having full control of what code is deployed to your website, you create your own architecture and limit what can be accessed.

### Grow with your business

As your business grows, so should your website. For custom web development teams, they build websites while keeping in mind how components will be added in the future. Here are things to consider when sizing-up:

1. **Architecture** - Custom developers pay attention to creating a scalable architecture that can accommodate growing traffic and increasing user demands. They'll also optimize the infrastructure to handle heavier loads efficiently.
2. **Flexible code-base** - As you need new features, blog content or sections, a custom built website is written in organized code making easier to add functionalities without disrupting the entire website.
3. **Integration** - Developers can leverage cloud services, content delivery networks (CDNs), and distributed computing architectures to handle additional requests that a business may need. Think about adding CRMs or connecting your website with an API.

Overall, custom web development empowers businesses to think about scalability from the beginning.

### Staying safe: web security

Your website is out there in the world and anyone can access it - make sure you have security parameters in place. When investing in a custom website, you're also taking steps to mitigate any risks with cybercrime. According to a [Cybersecurity Ventures report](https://cybersecurityventures.com/hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016){target="_blank"}, cybercrime is on the rise, costing trillions worldwide. Don't be a victim and save yourself from potential reputational damage and long-term costs. Your web development team will:

1. **Implement secure coding practices** - Custom developers will follow secure coding practices from the ground up. They implement security guidelines, such as input validation and proper authentication. They'll also set up protection against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting - ensuring that your data remains safe.
2. **Take appropriate security measures** - A term you may hear is "Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)," an encryption based internet security protocol. Web developers implement secure communication protocols (HTTPS) and access control parameters to protect sensitive data.
3. **Follow compliance standards** - Custom web development teams follow requirements assigned by the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), PCI DDS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).

Ready-for-you templates will not have these security measures in place. When working with a development company, be sure they're addressing these points.
