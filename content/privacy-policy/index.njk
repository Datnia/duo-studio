                <p>
                    We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining information

                    <strong>Sensitive Information.</strong>
                    We do not process sensitive information. All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and
                    accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.
                </p>
                <span>Information automatically collected</span>
                <p>
                    We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Site. This information does not reveal
                    your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as
                    your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device
                    name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Site, and other technical information. This
                    information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Site, and for our internal analytics and
                    reporting purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies
                    							and similar technologies.
                </p>
                <p>The information we collect includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <em>Device Data.</em>
                        We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the
                        Site. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server),
                        device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or
                        mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Location Data.</em>
                        We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How
                        much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Site. For example, we
                        may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP
                        address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by
                        disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain
                        aspects of the Site.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>How we process information</h2>
                <p>
                    We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Site,
                    including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>To request feedback.</strong>
                        We may process your information when necessary to request feedback and to contact you about your use of our
                        Site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>To market our services to you.</strong>
                        We may process the personal information you send to us for our marketing purposes, if this is in accordance with your
                        marketing preferences. You can opt out of our marketing emails at any time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>To save or protect an individual's vital interest.</strong>
                        We may process your information when necessary to save or protect an individual’s vital interest, such as to prevent
                        harm.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Cookies and other tracking technologies</h2>
                <p>
                    We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information.
                    Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie
                    Notice.
                </p>
                <h2>How long we keep your information</h2>
                <p>
                    We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy
                    notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal
                    requirements).<br/>
                    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
                    anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored
                    in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing
                    until deletion is possible.
                </p>
                <h2>How we keep your inforamtion safe</h2>
                <p>
                    We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the
                    security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information,
                    no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so
                    we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to
                    defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to
                    protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Site is at your own risk. You
                    should only access the Site within a secure environment.
                </p>
                <h2>Information from minors</h2>
                <p>
                    We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Site, you represent that
                    you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of
                    the Site. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will
                    deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware
                    of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
                    <a href="mailto:privacy@duo-studio.co">privacy@duo-studio.co</a>.
                </p>
                <h2>Do not track features</h2>
                <p>
                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or
                    setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
                    monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
                    been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
                    communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
                    the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
                </p>
                <h2>Updates to this notice</h2>
                <p>
                    We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date
                    and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy
                    notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a
                    notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your
                    information.
